# Interactive PDE Visualizations

Beautiful, interactive visualizations of partial differential equations and stochastic processes, inspired by 3Blue1Brown's aesthetic.

## Features

- **Transport Equation**: Visualize pure advection (∂ₜu + b·∂ₓu = 0) with characteristic lines
- **Transport with Source**: See how sources accumulate along characteristics
- **Laplace Equation**: Watch the relaxation to steady-state equilibrium
- **Brownian Motion on Circle**: Observe diffusion converging to uniform distribution


## Technical Notes

- Built with Plotly Dash (pure Python, no JavaScript required)
- Responsive design works on mobile
- All computations happen in browser after initial load
- No database needed - stateless app
